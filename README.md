# Refactoring Module 2 VBA Code and Measuring Performance
---
---
## Overview of Project
---
Steve, a recent college graduate with a finance degree, had asked for assistance with analyzing green energy stocks on behalf of his parents who are interested in investing. Steve was impressed by the original workbook that was prepared for him and would now like to expand his dataset to include additional stocks.
---
### Purpose
---
Using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) available in Excel, this project attempts to refactor the original code to once again loop through the original data and determine if the VBA script will run faster after refactoring the code. To prove the success of this endeavor, the following outputs will be provided:
- Pop-up message showing elapsed time to run analysis for 2017
- Pop-up message showing elapsed time to run analysis for 2018

### Summary
---


#### Advantages
Some advantages of refactoring code include improving the speed of the output and by streamlining the code to get rid of any unnecessary elements that may cause confusion or be misleading. Also, it could increase a programmer's productivity if they can make adjustments to a similar existing code rather than start a new one from scratch.

#### Disadvantages
On the other hand, refactoring code can be diasdavantageous if coders become to reliant on existing code thus effecting their creativity and critical thinking that might allow them to see "a new way of doing things". Also, a programmer might rely on an existing code that is ineffectice or sloppy resulting in wasting valuable time.
