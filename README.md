# Refactoring the Module 2 VBA Code and Measuring Performance
---
---
## Overview of Project
---
Steve, a recent college graduate with a finance degree, had asked for assistance with analyzing green energy stocks on behalf of his parents who are interested in investing. Steve was impressed by the original workbook that was prepared and would now like to expand his dataset to include the entire stock market.
---
### Purpose
---
Using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) available in Excel, this project attempts to refactor the original code to once again loop through the original data and determine if the VBA script will run faster after refactoring the code. To prove the success of this endeavor, the following outputs will be provided:
- Pop-up message showing elapsed time to run analysis for 2017
- Pop-up message showing elapsed time to run analysis for 2018
